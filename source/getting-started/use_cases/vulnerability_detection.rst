Vulnerability detection
=======================

Vulnerable software applications are commonly targeted by attackers to compromise endpoints and gain a persistent presence on targeted networks. The Wazuh platform, relying on its software inventory capabilities, maintains an up-to-date list of all applications installed on the endpoints on which the :ref:`Wazuh agent <wazuh_agent>` is installed. By correlating this information with the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), and with information collected from different operating system vendors, Wazuh is able to identify vulnerable applications and produce risk reports.  

In order to detect vulnerable software, Wazuh uses a database of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures  (CVE) created automatically by using data pulled from the following sources:

- `CVEs for Ubuntu Linux distributions <https://canonical.com>`_
- `CVEs for Red Hat and CentOS Linux distributions <https://access.redhat.com>`_
- `CVEs for Debian Linux distributions <https://www.debian.org>`_
- `CVEs for Arch Linux distributions <https://security.archlinux.org>`_
- `CVEs for SUSE Linux distributions <https://ftp.suse.com>`_
- `CVEs from the National Vulnerability Database <https://nvd.nist.gov/>`_
- `Microsoft Security Response Center <https://www.microsoft.com/msrc>`_

In order to enable vulnerability detection, users need to configure the :ref:`Wazuh agent <wazuh_agent>` to collect software inventory data, and the :ref:`Wazuh server <wazuh_server>` to pull CVEs information from the different vulnerability feeds. Here is an example of a vulnerability detection alert:
